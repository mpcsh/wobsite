# Contact

If you'd like to reach out to me for any reason at all, I'd love to hear from you! Please reach out via email at:

```
$ echo bUBtcGMuc2gK | base64 --decode
```

You can find my personal projects, etc, on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpcsh).

I post garbage on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LamdaCalrissian). I'm also an active user of [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/mpcsh).

If you'd like a copy of my resume, I'm happy to send it to you! I don't love the idea of posting it publicly, so please reach out to request it. Rest assured, it contains some truly tantalizing information.
