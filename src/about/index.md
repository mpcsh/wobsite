# About

Hi, I'm Mark. I like static type systems, cryptography, and networks. Outside the world of 1s and 0s, I enjoy backcountry skiing, billiards, Magic: the Gathering, biking, playing guitar, singing, backpacking, my dog, Spanish, traveling, and generally most other things about life. I also somehow don't think my interests define me as a person.

I'm currently an engineer at [Braintree](https://braintreepayments.com) on the Panels team, working on modernizing and internationalizing the new control panel. I'm also a delegate to [TC39](https://tc39.es).

I studied Computer Science at UChicago. There, I did some fun things for [Uncommon Hacks](https://uncommonhacks.com), religiously attended Hack Night, TA'ed a bunch, and wrote a [thesis on programming language design](https://github.com/mpcsh/ForML), advised by [Adam Shaw](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~adamshaw).
