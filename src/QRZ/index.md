Hi! I'm **Mark KK7QYZ (they)**, from Ballard, Seattle, WA.

I'm originally from Maryland and North Carolina, and I lived in and loved Chicago for six years before moving here at the very start of 2021.

I got my ticket in February 2024, and I'm studying for my General and Extra for that sweet, sweet vanity call sign.

My current shack is HT-focused — my primary transceiver is an Icom ID-50, which I adore so far. I have a couple telescoping antennas from Smiley for working the 2m band, at 1/2 and 5/8 wavelength, plus a delightfully glow-in-the-dark Signal Stick. I've also got an Explorer QRZ-1, and a Kenwood TH-D7 on loan from my Elmer (wink), **Eric AG6IE**. Rounding out the shack are some FRS and GMRS radios from Rocky Talkie that I love for mountain use — ski mountaineering, specifically — which was my gateway to ham radio.

Around Seattle you can catch me on WW7PSR fairly often. I love checking in to the PSRG daily nets, and do so fairly often both from home and from various parks and hideouts around the city.

I'm a musician and audiophile, and I love discussing music on the air! I usually include something I've been listening to lately in my net reports.

And as you might have gathered by now, I collect special interests like Pokémon — I'm also a ski mountaineer, software engineer, photographer, GeoGuessr tryhard, tabletop game enjoyer, and much more.

If you've got some follow-up for me, feel free to send me an email at the address on this page! I'd love to hear from you. You can find me elsewhere on the web at [mpc.sh](/).
