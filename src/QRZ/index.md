![The nonbinary pride flag, which is made from four horizontal stripes: yellow, white, purple, and black, from top to bottom.](/static/nonbinary-flag-2x1.svg)

Hi! I'm **Mark WA7MPC** — formerly **KK7QYZ**, from Seattle, WA. I'm nonbinary; my pronouns are **they/them**.

I'm originally from Maryland and North Carolina, and I lived in and loved Chicago for six years before moving here at the very start of 2021.

Ski mountaineering was my gateway to radio: staying in touch with my backcountry partners with Rocky Talkies really showed me the possibilities. Unsurprisingly, I gravitated quickly to [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk) after getting my ticket. When I'm not out in the mountains, you can occasionally catch me on one of our many wonderful social nets in the Puget Sound area.

I'm a musician and audiophile, and I love discussing music on the air! I usually include something I've been listening to lately when I check in to nets.

My shack at the moment comprises:

- An Icom ID-50, my primary handheld, which I adore. Icom really got me with their "near repeater" function. Incredible battery life and a great USB-C implementation make this my HT of choice.
- A Wouxun KG-Q10H, which I've so far only used once. I bought it for its cross-band repeat functionality and hosted a net from the summit of [Mt Pilchuck W7W/SN-105](https://sotl.as/summits/W7W/SN-105) with me as the repeater. Looking forward to doing this again soon!
- An Icom ID-5100 for mobile use, which I've been procrastinating installing. One of these days.
- An Icom IC-2730 for base station use, which I've also been procrastinating installing. Well, more accurately, I've been procrastinating mounting my Ed Fong TBJ-1 antenna to my roof and running a feed line in to my office. One of these days as well.
- An Elecraft KX2 for SOTA, paired with an ultralight end-fed half-wavelength antenna and a carbon mast. At some point I'll write up a post describing my HF SOTA kit — I've put a lot of time and effort into it.

And as you might have gathered by now, I collect special interests like Pokémon — I'm also a software engineer, photographer, GeoGuessr tryhard, pool shark, Magic: the Gathering player, tabletop game enjoyer, and much more.

If you've got some follow-up for me, feel free to send me an email at the address on this page! I'd love to hear from you. You can find me elsewhere on the web at [mpc.sh](/).
