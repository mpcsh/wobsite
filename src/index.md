# Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm an engineer primarily interested in programming language design and implementation.

I'm a delegate to [TC39](https://tc39.es), where I'm currently co-championing the [pattern matching proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching).

I'm nonbinary. My pronouns are `they/them`.

I live for ski mountaineering. I also live for music - I'm a guitarist and singer. I keep quarterly playlists on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/mpcsh), if you want to check out what I'm listening to.

If you'd like to chat, I'm reachable at <a id="addr" onmouseenter="fillAddr('YUdrPQ==')" onfocus="fillAddr('YUdrPQ==')" tabindex=0>_hover here..._</a>.
