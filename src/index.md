# Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm an engineer primarily interested in programming language design and implementation.

I currently work at [PayPal](https://paypal.com) on the Checkout Integrations team. I'm also a delegate to [TC39](https://tc39.es), where I'm currently co-championing the [pattern matching proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching).

I live to ski, specifically in the backcountry. Above: a photo of me atop a sketchy bootpack in Utah.

I studied Computer Science at UChicago. There, I did some fun things for [Uncommon Hacks](https://uncommonhacks.com), religiously attended Hack Night, worked a bunch as a TA, and wrote a [thesis on programming language design](https://github.com/mpcsh/ForML).
