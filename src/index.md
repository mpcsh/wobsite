# Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm an engineer primarily interested in programming language design and implementation.

I'm a delegate to [TC39](https://tc39.es), where I'm currently co-championing the [pattern matching proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching).

I live for ski mountaineering. I also live for music - I'm a guitarist and singer. I keep monthly playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/e8yylicycxba6487r7jbyotbo?si=wEo1wvS1SsaObFezR8DwJA), if you want to check out what I'm listening to.

I post garbage on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpcsh_), and I'm occasionally on [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/mpcsh). You can find my open-source work and personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpcsh).

If you'd like to chat, I'm reachable via:
- Email: `$ echo bUBtcGMuc2gK | base64 --decode`
- [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1171910612269654018)
