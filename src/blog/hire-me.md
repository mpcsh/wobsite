Let's go! I'm on the market, looking for senior IC roles in engineering.


## About me
You might know me from my work on [TC39](https://tc39.es), where I'm currently co-championing the [pattern matching proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching) and helping run the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://tc39.es/code-of-conduct).

I've been fortunate enough to wear a wide range of hats [throughout my career](/cv): from straight-ahead frontend product work, to platform engineering, and everything in between.

<div id="superpowers">

You can read the finer details on my [CV](/cv). But for now, here's a few of my superpowers:

</div>

- **A reverence for ergonomics and polish**. The fuzzy edge between humans and systems can create some thorny friction points; I sniff these out before the friction starts putting out heat. In the bigger picture, that last 5% to take an experience from functional to seamlessly delightful means the world to me.
- **A healthy dose of formal rigor**. Modeling complex systems, digesting those models and communicating them effectively, and helping others to do the same allows me to bring about shared understanding even in the thickest of technical forests.
- **Unshakable empathy in engineering**. Software, at its best, gives the world some of its time back. It is critically important to me that what I build can do this for _everyone_. I've spent time honing both my capacity to anticipate the needs of others, and my ability to identify my own unknown-unknowns.
- **Precise, compassionate, and adaptable communication**. Whether I'm writing an RFC, talking one-on-one, or presenting to a larger group, I put real care and effort in to how I communicate.
- **A battle-tested ability to reach consensus**. By reducing ambiguous, interlocking problems to their constituent needs and priorities, I'm able to break through deadlocks and drive alignment.
- **True language and platform agnosticism**. For me, the overhead involved in switching between frameworks and codebases (even completely unfamiliar ones) is minimal-to-negligible.


## About you
As I make my next move, I'm chiefly looking to play to my strengths: I want to maximize my impact by leaning on those superpowers. With that in mind, my ideal team:

- **Is highly collaborative** both internally and externally. I work best _with_ people, as opposed to being one among a field of silos. I love pair programming, but more broadly, I deeply value the daily opportunity for four-(or-more!)-hands-dirty work.
    - Similarly, I'm at my best when our work is tangible to the broader org, and when there is ample opportunity for direct collaboration with people beyond my immediate team.
- **Is composed of diverse, kind, lifelong learners** eager to grow together. I believe teams function best with a mix of folks at all different career stages, from grizzled principals to new grads. In particular, it says a lot to me if we're well set to support juniors.
- **Deeply values its employees**, reflected both by compensation and by cultural practices of sustainability and care.
- **Is culturally remote-first** — for the sake of empowering me and my teammates to work from where we work best, but also in our approach to documentation, knowledge sharing / management, and communication.

## Getting in touch
If you've got something that might be a fit, please drop me a line! I'd love to talk — and you can reach me at <a id="addr" onmouseenter="fillAddr('YUdseWFXNW4=')" onfocus="fillAddr('YUdseWFXNW4=')" tabindex=0>_hover here..._</a>.
