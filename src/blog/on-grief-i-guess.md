This year I buried my grandmother on my birthday.

It's funny &mdash; you don't think of birthdays and funerals as being events that can coincide. I've never read that story in a book, or seen it in film. But if you imagine the average number of close relatives each person leaves behind, surely it must happen [with some frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). There's something that feels vaguely symbolic about it, like a literary device that's half lost on me.

Five weeks before, I lost my other grandmother.

My maternal grandmother &mdash; my savta &mdash; was first. She had an array of physical health issues, and at some point the maintenance became too onerous. She was of sound mind when she asked for hospice care.

She endured an unfair amount of pain in her life. One by one, her family escaped from the Krakow ghettos, then hid from the Nazis together in the Polish countryside. She survived two different cancers and two (I think just two?) open-heart surgeries.

I called her a few times a week. She had a habit of repeating herself &mdash; there's nothing new here, my bed is very comfortable, your mother came to visit today. I didn't mind. I'd tell her about work, the mountains, my new life in Seattle. She would always abruptly bring phone conversations to a close when you weren't expecting it &mdash; my mother and I could never figure out why.

In the end she was granted release from her pain, and lived her last days in relative comfort. No struggling, no wincing. Or so my mother and sister tell me &mdash; she passed away fifteen minutes before my flight arrived. I think there's something vaguely symbolic in there, too.

My mother, sister, rabbi, and I were alone at the cemetery, save for the funeral home staff. My mother and I had both remained relatively composed for the few days prior, but my mother broke down when we said the mourner's kaddish, and I broke down when it was my turn to speak of our memories.

My paternal grandmother passed away slowly, over the course of nearly two weeks without food or water. She had been more or less unresponsive for nearly three years &mdash; I don't recall the last real conversation I had with her, or even when it would've been.

I was never very close with her; whenever we'd visit, she and my sister would spend time together, and I'd be with my grandpa. Looking back I feel pangs of regret for not working for that relationship, but I don't think I became the right version of myself until it was far too late.

She and my grandfather met when they were teenagers, and were married for [TODO: 77?] years.

The last two months have felt like a fever dream.

---

It has been a good long while since the radio static in my head parted for long enough to read a good book.

At the omnipresent behest of my best friend, I sobbed my way through Anthony Doerr's _All The Light We Cannot See_, completing it in a few large bursts spread over the last two months.

A dear friend of mine once told me that reading a book was a decent enough proxy for depression.

Three weeks after this summer of tragedy came to a close, I flew to visit a new and dear friend in San Francisco. My partner drove me to the airport early in the morning, in the cold and rain, and I sat glued to the airplane window, rapt as we breached the clouds and were granted a stunning view of four of the Cascade volcanoes in a line, shoulder to beautiful shoulder.

I had a lovely long weekend of firsts there. But what will stay with me forever, burned into my retinas, are the memories of Yosemite Valley &mdash; the first view of El Capitan, and the panorama of Half-Dome from the top of Eagle Peak, with the nourishing company of my friend. We _suffered_ to reach Eagle Peak, but the elation in my veins will never leave me.
