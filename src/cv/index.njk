				I am a generalist software engineer with a keen eye for detail. I hold particular expertise in web development, language design, and standards work.

			<p>
				I am an exceptionally fast learner, and pride myself on my ability to quickly take up any skill from first principles.
			</p>
			<p>
				In working from first principles, I approach technical work with a healthy theoretical rigor, tempered by pragmatism.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a collaborator by default. I put real care and effort into communicating with compassion, trust, precision, and concision.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether it's web development or API design, I think like an interior designer: ergonomics, accessibility, and polish are always top-of-mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have experience-forged skill in driving consensus among folks with competing needs and priorities.

			<div class="heading">Ethics</div>
			<p>
				It is impossible for technology to be neutral or apolitical; the conditions of society and the workplace are written into the systems we build.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is my responsibility to ensure that the systems I build cannot be weaponized to do harm.

				As a <b>
					<a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</a> Champion</b>, I am designing the proposal's syntax and semantics, drafting spec text, and presenting on our work. This work is highly collaborative, involving a team of co-Champions and stakeholders representing the browsers.

			</div>
			<p>
				On the <b>Node.js Platform team</b>, I served the needs of most Netflix developers using JavaScript in any capacity.
			</p>
			<p>
				I migrated the ~million-instance fleet of production apps using our <a href="https://openjsf.org/blog/2020/09/24/from-streaming-to-studio-the-evolution-of-node-js-at-netflix/">NodeQuark</a> platform to support IPv6 in collaboration with my teammate.
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked on outwardly-transparent reimplementations of two legacy core services underpinning NodeQuark — migrating them from Spring to our own NodeQuark platform — in collaboration with my teammates.
			</p>
			<p>
				I staffed a lively on-call rotation and fielded a variety production incidents including DDoS, targeted exploit attempts, invisible memory leaks, and failovers of entire regions.

			<p>
				On the <b>Desktop Foundations team</b>, I maintained Slack's core Electron / RxJS desktop app.
			</p>
			<p>
				I overhauled our handling of user preferences to support the <a href="https://slack.com/solutions/govslack">GovSlack</a> initiative, and built a new mechanism to externally configure those preferences. I found and resolved several invisible security and robustness issues in the process.

				On <b>Team Panels</b>, I built and maintained a React / Flow / Redux app and a Java proxy that replaced the legacy merchant control panel page-by-page.
			</p>
			<p>
				I led the first PayPal / Braintree i18n collaboration, working with their translators to create our localized bundles. I implemented a versioned continuous delivery process for those bundles — and for our two core apps in the process — and designed and built a frontend library for localizing our web app.
			</p>
			<p>
				I built a type-safe data model for chargeback disputes, and in the process uncovered deeper inconsistencies in adjacent models.

				I led an effort to scrub our documentation of racist <code>whitelist</code> / <code>blacklist</code> terminology.

			</div>
			<p>
				On my way to a <b>BSc in Computer Science</b>, I completed a thesis advised by <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~adamshaw">Adam Shaw</a>. I created a type-sound, purely functional <a href="https://github.com/mpcsh/ForML">language</a> capable of imperative-esque iteration. This work was <a href="https://github.com/mpcsh/ForML/blob/main/paper.pdf">written up</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8rnVjCZ570">presented</a> to an audience of students and professors. In the process, I discovered and rectified an incompleteness in a foundational type inference algorithm for type classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				I staffed five offerings of three classes as a teaching assistant for <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja">Borja Sotomayor</a>, including the first two offerings of Introduction to Software Engineering, where I acted as a tech lead to student teams developing major pieces of software in C, including <a href="https://github.com/cmsc22000-project-2018">a Redis trie library & app suite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-cs/chiventure">an interactive fiction game engine</a>.
