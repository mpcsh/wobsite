Last spring quarter, I had the incredible privilege to TA for a new class in the UChicago CS department: CMSC 22000, Intro to Software Engineering.

## Course structure overview
The class was organized into two phases. The first was a traditional lecture-based structure: each class (thrice per week) was a lecture on some fundamental software engineering concept (e.g. version control, libraries and linking, etc).

## The little things - why it worked so well
## Final presentations
## You can see their code too!
